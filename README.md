# Statistical Analysis of NBA 2K Player Rating Trends

Used Python to analyze trends in NBA 2K player ratings. 

Created beautifully color-coded histograms, bell curves, dot plots, boxplots, and line graphs to break down trends in player ratings by game year (2K13, 2K14, 2K15, 2K16) and position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C).

##Technology

Written in Python, relying heavily on the Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas libraries for statistical analysis and graphing.

##Images

Look in the `/plots` folder to view all the graphs generated by running `scripts.py`.

##Data

Parsed into a master Excel spreadsheet by `parse.py`. Manual adjusts needed to be made for nicknames, conflicting records, duplicates, etc. Data taken from [here](http://hoopshype.com/2016/08/29/these-are-the-ratings-of-all-players-in-nba-2k17/) and [here](http://thereal2kinsider.blogspot.com/2012/09/official-nba-2k13-ratings.html).
